Goal
----
::

    Sleep Hacker, I became interested by Lucid Dreaming in the end of 2010. As
    I want to use my computer to its full potential, I'm going to build a smart
    software to manage everything related to Lucid Dreaming
                                                            - Adrien Lemaire

..


In this program, I plan to do:

- Alarm / growl notifications to remember me :

  * cardiac respiration
  * reality check (like watching oneâ€™s hand)
  * other stuff to do during the day

- Window to fill one's dream on the morning, format it in LateX format and save
  data for future statistics


What's done yet?
----------------

- startup script to show a growl notification every hours


Prerequisite
------------

- Mac Os X 10.6 [1]_
- `Python 2.6.X`_ 
- Growl_ (and growlnotify, which is located in the Growl's Extras directory)


Installation
------------
::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ sudo port install py26-pyqt4
    $ #python setup.py install
    $ mv LaunchAgents/com.apple.RealityCheck.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    $ mv bin/reality_check /usr/local/bin/
    $ mv Pictures/RealityCheck ~/Pictures
    $ # modify the PYTHONPATH in com.apple.RealityCheck.plist by yours
    $ # modify the PATH_IMAGE in reality_check by your path::
    $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.RealityCheck.plist

* I'll create an installer later *

.. [1] I'll use launchd to manage the startup scripts. Linux users will have to
   adapt it for init.d
